- Used Naive Bayes Classifier and got 55% accuracy as the project accuracy wasn't the concern and it took around 100 seconds to run. 
- Also, Used RandomForestClassifier and the accuracy jumped to 65% (10% more) and it took around 110 seconds to do all the preprocessing and prediction.
- The approach was simple and traditional. First, preprocess the data, then train the training data and test on test data.
- The solution can be more ideal if we use TextBlob(inbuild) algorithm or use better algorithm or of course deep learning algorithm.
